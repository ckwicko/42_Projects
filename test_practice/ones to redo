maybe like 1 or 2 from C00

C01

ex01
why are the pointers to pointers stored in main
why do we use the address of nbr 2 with the function

ex02
remember to use double int instead of single
	printf("%d %d\n", x, y);

        printf("%d\n", num1, num2);

ex03
remember to use &newvariable when you want to copy a previous functions varible value

ex04
why does this use & in the first line and not second, something to do with pointers and addresses
        ft_ultimate_div_mod(&c, &d);
        printf("div %d, remain %d\n", c, d);


C02

ex00
almost, just in main seperate called function and printf and remember to add null terminator to dest in function

ex01
so close again just used src[i] < n instead of i < n in first while loop and forgot i++ in second while loop

ex06
make sure to use - instead of +
make sure to use && instead of ||
